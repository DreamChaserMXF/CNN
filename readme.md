Paper
===========
Beyond Deep Residual Learning for Image Restoration : Persistent Homology-Guided Manifold Simplification
* Accepted at CVPRW 2017.
* Arxiv : [https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06345]
* Field for 'Super resolution & Gaussian Denoising'

Implementation
===========
* Matconvnet (matconvnet-1.0-beta20)

Learned network
===========
* We plan to upload 'learned network for NTIRE competition (CVPRW 2017)' to other places due to capacity.
* Learned networks for 'Denosing and SISR' has been uploaded.
